# Repository Cleanup Log

This document tracks the changes made to transform this from a business-specific website to an educational example repository.

## Completed Changes âœ…

### Project Renaming
- **Package name**: `nextjs` â†’ `social-selling-next-sanity-challenge-repo`
- **Version**: `0.1.0` â†’ `1.0.0`
- **Purpose**: Added educational context to README.md and CLAUDE.md

### Page Cleanup
- **Removed pages**: 15 business-specific page templates and components
- **Kept pages**: Home, About Founder (formerly About Mario), Legal, Blog Overview, Blog Post
- **Template consistency**: Ensured all remaining pages have both template and component files

### Content Generalization
- **PageAboutMario** â†’ **PageAboutFounder** (more generic naming)
- Updated all imports, types, and component references
- Maintained functionality while removing business-specific branding

### Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite for educational purpose
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added educational guidelines and learning objectives
- **CLEANUP_LOG.md**: This file for tracking changes

## Remaining Business-Specific Content ðŸ”„

The following items still contain business-specific content but are kept to demonstrate real-world examples:

### Image Assets
- `/public/about-mario/` - Contains founder photos (demonstrates personal branding patterns)
- `/public/home/` - Contains business-specific hero images (shows image optimization patterns)
- `/public/global/badges/` - Contains award/certification badges (demonstrates trust element patterns)

### Content References
- Component text still references trading/investment terminology
- This is intentional to show how content management works with real examples
- New developers can practice by updating this content through Sanity CMS

### Configuration Files
- Sanity schemas still contain business-specific field names
- This demonstrates real-world CMS structure
- Good for learning how to work with existing content structures

## Educational Value ðŸ“š

These remaining business elements serve educational purposes:

1. **Real-world complexity**: Shows how actual projects look, not simplified examples
2. **Content management**: Demonstrates working with existing content in CMS
3. **Image optimization**: Shows Next.js image handling with real assets
4. **Component patterns**: Illustrates how UI components work with actual data
5. **Refactoring practice**: Provides opportunities for learners to practice code cleanup

## Next Steps for Learners ðŸŽ¯

New developers can practice by:

1. **Content updates**: Change business terms to generic equivalents via Sanity
2. **Image replacement**: Replace business images with placeholder/generic ones
3. **Schema modification**: Update Sanity field names to be more generic
4. **Component refactoring**: Rename components and props for better clarity
5. **Style customization**: Update colors, fonts, and branding to match a different theme

This approach provides both working examples and improvement opportunities for learning.
